# 🌿 Soma — Feel Grounded Again
*A mindful somatic exercise app designed to help users reconnect with their bodies through simple, guided movements and awareness-based practices.*

## 🧘 About Soma
**Soma** was designed with one goal: to help people feel grounded again.  
Through short exercises and mood-based practices, users can release tension, improve focus, and rebuild a healthy connection between mind and body.

The UI is built to feel calm and welcoming — minimal, warm, and organic — staying true to the Figma prototype.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Minimal & Organic:** Inspired by nature and calm tones, Soma avoids clutter and distraction.  
- **Body Awareness First:** Progress is felt, not measured. Soma promotes embodied presence over productivity.  
- **Accessible & Gentle:** High-contrast text, soft visuals, and touch-friendly controls for all users.  
- **Figma-Driven Development:** Every screen mirrors the prototype created in Figma for consistent visuals.
